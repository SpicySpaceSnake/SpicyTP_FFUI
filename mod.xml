<Mod
	name="SpicyTP:FFUI 1.2.2"
	description="A texturepack that gives gives Noita's UI a heavy, metallic aesthetic.
Created for the Youtuber and Twitcher 'FuryForged'.
Tip: If two texture packs replace the same sprite, the pack lowest in the mod list takes priority over that sprite.
To function correctly with SpicyTP:Core, this mod must be placed AFTER it in the load order."
